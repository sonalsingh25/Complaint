- The user can either login to their existing account or can signup for a new account. They can lodge a new complaint by filling up a form and providing all the necessary details.

- Users have the access to their complaint history where they can track the status of their complaints. On dashboard, they can have a look at the number of complaints raised, processed and are in process.
